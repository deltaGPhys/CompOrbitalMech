    "### BRIEF COURSE DESCRIPTION ###\n",
    "An important topic in astrodynamics is the solution of boundary value problems with mixed boundary conditions and optimization of an object function. This directed studies course will focus on learning the techniques involved and applying them to a problem in astrodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LEARNING OBJECTIVES###\n",
    "*\t Understand the fundamentals of selected numerical techniques in the solution of boundary value problems with mixed boundary conditions without and with optimization.\n",
    "* \tApply the techniques to problems in astrodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### COURSE STRUCTURE AND LEARNING RESOURCES TO BE USED ###\n",
    "1. \tDocument the fundamentals of the single shooting technique for boundary value problems with mixed boundary condition without and with optimization. Demonstrate proficiency by application to solution of specific examples. \n",
    "2.  \tDocument the fundamentals of the multiple shooting technique for boundary value problems with mixed boundary condition without and with optimization. Demonstrate proficiency by application to the solution of specific examples. \n",
    "3. \tApply the numerical techniques to a solved problem in astrodynamics to demonstrate proficiency.\n",
