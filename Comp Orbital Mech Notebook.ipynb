    "Predicting future behavior given initial conditions is helpful in many cases, but it does not solve the specific problem of spacecraft trajectory planning. In this case, it is generally the initial and final positions which are known. The initial velocity is a parameter to be determined such that the trajectory leads to the desired final position. This class of problems will be investigated via the <i>shooting method</i>.\n",
    "#### Example: Cooling Fin\n",
    "In order to practice implementing the shooting method, we consider the temperature profile along a cooling fin. One end of the fin is held at 500 K and we want the other end to be at 400 K. Assume that the fin is in an environment with temperature 300 K. The unknown parameter is the spatial rate of change along the bar $\\dfrac{dT}{dx}$ at the 500 K end of the bar. The temperature along the rest of the bar is then determined by simple integration:\n",

    "The derivatives are determined by a constant $m^2$:\n",
    "$$\\left(\\dfrac{dT}{dx}\\right)_{n+1}=m^2(T_n-T_\\infty)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is played forward, the temperature of the end of the bar is then compared to the desired end-of-bar temperature and the initial $\\dfrac{dT}{dx}$ guess is adjusted up or down depending on the results. This can be done in a binary search or a secant algorithm, which makes a guess proportional to the observed error. For a linear system, this would produce the correct value on the third iteration; for a non-linear system, it would simply increase the speed of convergence.\n",
